### Hi there! üòÅ

My name is Rafael Zanini Francucci. I'm a front-end developer (ReactJS) | with great curiosity in data science, machine learning and A.I.

In my free time, I basically focus on four points:: <br />
1 - To Practice sports to keep me mentally and physically healthy. <br />
2 - To study to maintain what I already know and improve my knowledge; <br />
3 - Have a simple life with friends and family to never forget how the life can be wonderful. <br />
4 - Have a strong relationship with God to never forget who I am.  <br />
