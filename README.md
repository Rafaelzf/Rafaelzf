[en] Hello! 😁

My name is Rafael Zanini Francucci. I'm a front-end developer (ReactJS) | with great curiosity in data science, machine learning and A.I.

In my spare time I basically focus on three points:

1 - Practicing sports to keep me in good spirits, mentally and physically.
2 - Study practice, to maintain what I already know and acquire new information;
3 - Socializing with friends and family to never forget who I am.
