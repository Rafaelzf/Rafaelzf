### Hi there! üòÅ

My name is Rafael Zanini Francucci. I'm a front-end developer (ReactJS) | with great curiosity in data science, machine learning and A.I.

In my spare time, I basically focus on four points: <br />
1 - Playing sports to keep me in a good mood, mentally and physically. <br />
2 - Study practice, to maintain what I already know and acquire new information; <br />
3 - Living with friends and family to never forget the taste of life. <br />
4 - Maintain a relationship with God to never forget who I am.  <br />
