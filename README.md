### Hi there! 😁

 My name is Rafael Zanini Francucci from Brazil (🇧🇷). I'm a front-end developer (ReactJS) | with a great curiosity in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
 
[en] In my free time I like to practice brazilian Jiu-jitsu (🥋), bodybuilding (💪🏼), run (🏃🏼), read (📚), watch anime (👻), Studying philosophy (:owl:), watch NBA, soccer and UFC (🏀⚽🤼), chat with friends (🗣️) and stay with my family (👨‍👩‍👧). Is there anything better?

Would you like to find me?
